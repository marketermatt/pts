This framework was compiled to help developers build theme options and use the options for themes. TO make this work you will need to add this framework folder to the theme folder and include the "framework/init.php file in "functions.php".

In init.php you can go ahead and define your environment variables. Also in framework/enqueues you can enqueue your JS and CSS files easily. 

Build your options in framework/theme-options.php.
